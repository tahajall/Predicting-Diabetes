# Predicting-Diabetes
In this project we made a machine learning model using classic machine learning technics such as random forests and R programming lamguage.
This was a project for regression analysis course.
\n The questions answered in this project :
1- Does this data set have any chance for predicting diabetes?
2- Which features have the most power in predicting diabetes?
3- Could we use a subset of the features to make a predicting model ?
4- What is your strategy in using test, train and validation sets to predict the final model? Which features was used in the final model?
5- Could we ask a few questions and predict the risk of diabetes in a person with an acceptable accuracy ?
